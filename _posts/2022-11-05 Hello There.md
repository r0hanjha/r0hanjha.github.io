# Hello There!

Hello, and welcome to my personal website! This website was made due to my frustration one night before my CE 463 quiz due to the sparsity of information avail about doing an MS in Civil Engineering. While there is a plethora of information available on doing an MS in CS or most other fields that have been collated in a single location, for some odd reason, there aren't any useful sites for those looking to do an MS in Civil Engineering.

In the future, I also plan on hosting my notes in case someone finds them useful. Although most of them will be for my 4th Year Courses.

Immediately I will be uploading my notes for the following courses:-

* CE 401: Water Resource Engineering
* CE 463: Introduction to Probability & Statistics
* CE 410: Introduction to Offshore Engineering
