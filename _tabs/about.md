Hi! I'm Rohan, a 4<sup>th</sup> Year Undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay) majoring in Civil Engineering. I enjoy playing Lawn Tennis and CSGO and watching horror movies. Academically my interests lie in Offshore Engineering and wave energy harnessing. 

In the Summer of 2022, I interned at Invenics in London, United Kingdom as a Technology Consultant. I have served previously served as a Teaching Assitant for BB 101 and was extensively involved with the Undergraduate Academic Council. 

I am currently working on reducing Vortex-induced Vibrations in Spar Platforms in deep water conditions.
